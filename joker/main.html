            <h2>DESIGNING</h2>
            <p>For this particular stage i had to pretend that the joker movie had not yet come out and watch as many trailers and teasears that came out before the actual movie. I remember that I did not come up with the wireframes at all and by the time i watched the final trailer I pretty much had a very clear vision of what i wanted down to even the hover effects. So I just dived into designing!</p>
