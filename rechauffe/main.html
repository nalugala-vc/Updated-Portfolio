            <p><b>Rechauffe Foods: A UI/UX Journey into Sustainable Culinary Innovation</b>

                Hello there!
                
                I'm thrilled to take you on a journey through the creation of Rechauffe Foods, a revolutionary food waste management application that marries sustainability with delightful culinary experiences. This UI/UX case study showcases the evolution of the app, its features, and the driving force behind its design and creation.TThis project was undertaken as a requirement for my third-year Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) course and is actually a full stack project which means its currently a fully functional application</p>

                <h2><b>PROBLEM</b> STATEMENT</h2>
                <p>Food wastage is a rampant issue currently.  This is caused by busy schedules leading to poor meal planning, inefficient use of ingredients, and poor eating habits.
                    The reasons outlined above eventually lead to a lot of food being leftover, and in the end, disposed of.
                    </p>
                <h2>GOAL</h2>
                <p>To design a mobile application that uses Recommender systems to help users come up with meals to cook using leftover ingredients.

                    <h3>Research Goal</h3>
                    <p>The aimed to delve into the current behaviors, attitudes, and challenges surrounding food waste, meal planning, and the utilization of leftovers. I was particularly interested in identifying user preferences and expectations for a mobile application designed to address these issues. The primary focus was on creating an understanding of how individuals manage food waste and exploring their needs when it comes to personalized recipes generated from leftover ingredients.</p>
